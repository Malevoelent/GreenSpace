      <h1>Today's issues</h1>
      <p>Global warming, climate change, and carbon emissions—mainly caused by human actions—are damaging our planet, and urgent action is needed to protect the environment and our future.</p>

    <div class="row introduction">

            <h2>Global Warming</h2>
            <p>Global warming refers to the ongoing rise in Earth’s average surface temperature, mainly due to human activities like burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas. These actions release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. As a result, we are seeing melting glaciers, rising sea levels, more intense heatwaves, and disrupted ecosystems. The main cause of global warming is the excessive buildup of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide (CO₂), which traps heat in the atmosphere.</p>

            <h2>Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Climate change is a broader issue that includes global warming and also refers to long-term changes in temperature, weather patterns, rainfall, and storm activity across the planet. Some visible examples include more severe hurricanes, increasing droughts in regions like Africa, and frequent flooding in parts of Asia. These changes are not only harming the environment but also creating serious human challenges, such as food shortages, health risks, and forced migration.</p>

            <h2>Carbon Emissions</h2>
            <p>Carbon emissions refer to the release of carbon dioxide (CO₂) into the atmosphere, which is a major contributor to global warming and climate change. These emissions mainly come from human activities such as transportation (cars, planes), power generation from fossil fuels, industrial factories, and deforestation. When trees are cut down, not only is CO₂ released, but the planet also loses natural tools for absorbing it. Reducing carbon emissions is essential for slowing down the damage to our environment and protecting the planet for future generations.</p>

            <p>Behind every blooming garden is a story of hope, resilience, and transformation. In this section, we celebrate the individuals and communities who have turned small patches of soil into powerful symbols of change. From first-time gardeners discovering the joy of planting, to entire neighborhoods growing their own food and reconnecting with nature — these stories highlight the real impact of gardening on people’s lives. Whether it's boosting food security, improving mental well-being, or creating green spaces for learning and connection, our programs are helping everyday heroes cultivate something beautiful. Read on to meet the inspiring people behind the plants — and see how your support helps them grow.</p>

            <h2>Gardening for Health, Healing, and Hope</h2>
            <p>For many individuals, especially those facing physical or emotional challenges, gardening offers more than just an outdoor hobby — it’s a path toward healing. In our therapeutic garden programs, people coping with illness, grief, trauma, or stress find solace in nature’s gentle rhythms. The act of digging in the soil, nurturing a plant, and witnessing life unfold provides a sense of control, achievement, and peace. Participants often describe how gardening improves their mood, sharpens their focus, and offers a meaningful escape from the pressures of daily life. Beyond personal benefits, these programs foster connection by bringing together people with shared experiences, creating supportive communities where everyone can heal and grow. Through gardening, individuals rediscover their own strength and resilience — and remind us all of the remarkable power of nature to restore both land and spirit.</p>

            <h2>Empowering the Next Generation of Growers</h2>
            <p>Youth programs in gardening are not just about teaching kids how to plant seeds; they’re about equipping the next generation with the skills, confidence, and curiosity to care for the world around them. Through hands-on workshops, school gardens, and after-school clubs, young people learn where food comes from, how ecosystems work, and why sustainability matters. They take pride in harvesting the fruits (and vegetables!) of their labor, and they gain a sense of responsibility that extends beyond the garden. We’ve seen students blossom as leaders — mentoring younger kids, proposing green initiatives at their schools, and even inspiring their families to start home gardens. By empowering young people with knowledge and opportunity, we’re planting the seeds of a greener, healthier future — one where today’s learners become tomorrow’s changemakers.</p>
